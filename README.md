Python Project on Restaurant Management System
Ambrosia Pure Veg Restaurant

This is an user-friendly,easy to use,simple GUI based application using tkinter package of python and used sqlite3 at the backend for a restaurant management system.Basically, it provides a user interface to the receptionist in a restaurant to generate bill and automatically generates a pdf as well which gets saved in the same directory under the reference no. generated randomly. 
On providing the Food Items, their respective prices are fetched from the database and computations are done them to provide the total amount to the user. Our system also generates error on giving wrong input. 
The GUI and database are synced and also the pdf generation system makes it user friendly.
We have made appealing to the user as well by providing lot of styling and a logo of our restaurant as well.
